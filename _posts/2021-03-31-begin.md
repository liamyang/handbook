In this guide, I will be showing you how to create the structure of a website!

What's HTML? It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It makes up all of the websites you see, even this one!

## A Simple HTML Page

### Create the file

First and foremost, create a new document anywhere on your computer. If you're on a Windows PC, open File Explorer and enable **File name extensions**. Now name the text document `index.html`.

### Edit the file

Open the file using your favourite text editor. Add `<p>This is the beginning of something great...</p>` at the start of it.

### Opening the file

Open the file in your web browser. Congrats! You just made a simple HTML page.
